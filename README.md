Hello, this is a README file for the Falling Words game, my first web programming project.

Want to test or improve your typing skills? Falling Words game is an entertaining way to do just that.

# This game:
- is available in your browser
- enables to track score for several players during one session
- incorporates logic for winning and losing
- has separate HTML/CSS/JS files
- was built with KISS and DRY concepts in min-width
- uses JS for DOM manipulation
- is a working game deployed online for everyone to see
- uses semantic markup for HTML and CSS



# Further Improvements to Be Done:
- timer to stop the game at a point in time
- sounds
- additional animation:
  - words exploding, changing colors, blinking etc.
  - add word visual for when the answer is correct (and fix flickering)
- utilize random word generation API
- make the words fall simultaneously
- introduce different levels of playing, including separate levels for training different fingers/hands / different keyboard areas
- add an option to play a math game
